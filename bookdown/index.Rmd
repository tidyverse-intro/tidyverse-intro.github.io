# Prerequisites {-}

### Audience: Beginner to Intermediate R Users {-}

This book replicates the materials developed for a workshop for the [Cascadia-R conference](https://cascadiarconf.com) meant to be a gentle introduction to the tidyverse for data wrangling and visualization. 

### What You'll Learn {-}

[Part 1 - Aesthetics and `ggplot2`](#ggplot2)

[Part 2 - Factors and `ggplot2`](#factors)

[Part 3 - Manipulating Data using `dplyr`](#dplyr)

[Part 4 - The Whys and Hows of Tidy Data using `tidyr`](#tidy)

[Part 5 - More on factors with `forcats`](#factors2)

### Before We Get Started {-}

Before continuing, please make sure that R and RStudio are installed on your laptop. (You should have version 3.3 or higher for R and version 1.0 or higher of RStudio.)  Then install the `tidyverse`, `gapminder`, `fivethirtyeight`, and `rmarkdown` packages from CRAN using the following command:

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "fivethirtyeight", "rmarkdown"))
```
